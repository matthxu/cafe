# Linenfog Caf√©

A personal project showcasing a modern and sleek online storefront for a fictitious cafe.

## Overview

Optimised for mobile and wider screens alike, the website aims to replicate the experience of visting a physical store and invite customers to explore and learn more about their local cafe. The user-friendly home interface is divided into multiple seamless segments - all of which can be accessed within a single page for ease of use. These segments include an 'about' portion, menu and coffee beans section, an interactive map in addition to a contact form.

The demo and screenshots of the website can be accessed directly below.
